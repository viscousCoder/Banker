## Project Description

The **Bankist Project** is a simple banking website where I implemented several front-end features. The project focuses on learning and implementing:

- **Custom Lazy Loading**: This feature loads content dynamically as the user interacts with the page, improving performance and reducing load times.
- **Slider Concept**: Implementing a slider for smooth transitions and enhanced user interaction.
- **Navbar Link Transitions**: Adding smooth transition effects when users click on the navbar links, allowing for a seamless experience while navigating between sections of the website.
